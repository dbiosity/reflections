**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**

Using remote repository would be useful over solely local one when sharing, collaborating with others, or contributing to larger projects.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**

This would help you have better control and not force you to lose updates you may be working on locally.

**Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?**

Forks copy a repository to your Github account, cloning copies it locally, and branching makes divergent paths in same repository.
